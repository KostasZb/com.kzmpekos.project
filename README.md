A prototype web application called Farmers Market built with the Spring Framework following a microservice design. The project was completed during my MSc Computing dissertation.
The Back-end was built with Java with the use of gRPC for communication between microservices. A service built with the MVC design was used for orchestrating the microservices.
HTML5 and Bootstrap were used in order to create a responsive interface and some JQuery was used to provide some of the functionality.
